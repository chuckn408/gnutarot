	This is a very simple, text-based tarot card program.  It will be very easy for others to add images and/or UI afterward.  I would recommend keeping such developements as simplistic as possible.
	The deck in question will be focused on the most commonly known Waite deck.  There are twenty-two Major Arcana and 54 Minor Arcana. The suits in mind will be the traditional Cups, Wands, Swords and Coins.
	How it works is "Tarot" runs randomly generated numbers to query which card information to request from "Cards.txt". The first generation determines the card, the second determines whether or not it's flipped.  Finally, output is displayed.

	Press Q to quit to Main Menu; again to exit program
	Press [1-9] to choose card layout.
	Press E/D to scroll Up/Down.
